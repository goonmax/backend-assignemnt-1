# backend-assignemnt-1


This project will require node.js and mySQL to work.
I've made the login username and password 'admin' lower case when you open the project. 


Once you've logged in feel free to make yourself a new username and password with new privileges.
Note: you will not be able to make any changes if you make your account a trainee/standard.
The Designer buttons are still a working progress do not click on them as, they will take you to a dead page. 
Once you have logged in click on the 'Add Item' button this will take you to a page where you can add things to the database. 
The picture in the top left of the screen will redirect you back to the front page  where you can see what you have just added. 
To be able to edit it click on the green 'edit' button by scrolling across will the scroll bar underneath the database items. 
Once you're in there you will be able to edit, delete and restore earlier versions.
